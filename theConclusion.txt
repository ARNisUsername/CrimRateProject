Many conservatives including Trump state that democratic states and cities have much higher crime rates than republican ones due to bad progressive policy. 
However, after looking at the data of property and violent crime rates in the states, we can infer that there is NO correlation between blue and red states and their crime rates

State Crime Rates: By looking at the Property and Violent Crimes Rates for states, although Democratic states are slightly higher in terms of crime, there is no correlation.

Many conversatives also point that urban cities that are Blue have higher crime rates than urban cities that are Red. 
However, after looking at the data of property and violent crime rates in urban cities of states, we can infer that there is also NO correlation of parties and crime rates.

City Crime Rates: Ironically, Republican cities have slightly higher crime rates than Democratic Ones. However, it is not a big enough cap for there to be a correlation

TL;DR: Despite the claims by conversatives, there is no correlation between blue and red states/cities and crime rates.
